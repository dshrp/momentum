## 🎯 The Problem We're Solving

Your friends are constantly posting about events, but you're missing them because social media algorithms hide posts and stories disappear after 24 hours.

**Momentum automatically finds and organizes your friends' events** so you never have to worry about missing out on the good times again.

## ✨ How Momentum Works

### 📱 Monitor Instagram
We track your friends' Instagram accounts for event posts and stories, catching everything the algorithm might hide.

### 📋 Organize Everything  
All events are automatically organized in one clean dashboard, with calendar integration and sharing features.

### 🔮 Coming Soon
We'll add more event page support and send Wednesday roundups to your inbox of events.

## 🎨 Why I Built This

My name's Daniel. I'm an artist, musician, and organizer in Detroit and NYC. With so much information lately blasted my way, I was constantly missing my friends' events. They'd post about a show or party on Instagram, but I wouldn't see it until after it happened. The algorithm would hide their posts, or I'd miss their stories because I wasn't checking at the right time.

As someone in the creative community, I have friends who are DJs, artists, poets, and event organizers. They're always doing cool stuff, but keeping track of it all was impossible.

So I built Momentum to solve this problem for myself and my friends. Now, I know what's happening when, and I can show up for my friends—in a time where showing up matters more than ever.

## 🚀 Perfect For
